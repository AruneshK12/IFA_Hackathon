# IFA_Hackathon
A disaster management application(android) created during the IFA hackathon
To Run the AASHA App in Android Studio: -
  1. Unzip the file and open project from Android studio
Why Disaster Management Apps?
  -> Disaster management apps are made with the intention of reducing the loss of life and property during disasters, and to help people to cope with the after-effects of disasters.
  ->They provide users with potentially life saving information and help them to reach out for aid.

Problems with current applications?
-> The apps currently in use are not user-friendly
-> Most apps have either a GPS based mapping system or generate live disaster news. Very few of them integrate these 2 aspects.

Why AASHA?
  -> AASHA integrates both a GPS based mapping system and live disaster updates to give maximum support during disasters.
  -> Disasters may disrupt data networks, rendering internet based apps almost useless. But AASHA is different in that it can be used to prepare oneself before disasters by providing important information.

APP overview
  -> The two main components of this app are :-  geolocation based map and weather updates which would help in preparing for any disaster.
  -> Besides this the app provides important guidelines to survive during different disasters.
  -> It also lists the items necessary for an emergency kit.

SPECIAL FEATURES: -
  1. GPS Mapping System
    -> It obtains the users current location and provides real time information regarding the hospitals, police stations, and other helpful organizations.
    -> It provides the user with the birdâ€™s eye view of the surroundings and helps in planning evacuation routes.
   
  2. Weather Forecast
   -> Gives live weather updates  thus allowing the user to be prepared 
	        => for adverse climatic conditions.
   -> Helps farmers make suitable arrangements in the event of a climatic hazard.

FUTURE PROSPECTS
    -> Can be expanded to  provide information about disaster prone areas and safe zones.	
    -> As of now the app covers only Chennai, but it can be extended  	to cover much larger areas.
    -> Machine Learning can be incorporated to study weather patterns and predict the occurrence of any climatic hazards with greater accuracy.
    -> The model can be made to receive data directly from weather stations and satellites to provide real time information  about natural calamities.
